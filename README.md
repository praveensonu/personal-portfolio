# Simple Portfolio Template

This repository provides a template for sharing work as an online portfolio (website).
It was designed primarily for Data Scientists sharing their R projects,
with each project representing an `html` file (such as the product of knitting `Rmd`)
or a website (such as produced by a `shiny` app).
